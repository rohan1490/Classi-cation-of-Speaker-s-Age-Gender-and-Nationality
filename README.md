# Classification-of-Speaker-s-Age-Gender-and-Nationality

Audio classification remains one of the most complex and challenging problems in the 21st century.
While much analysis and research has been adopted in audio classification in sub-categories of audio scene classification and bio-acoustics, there has been very few researches adopting Human voice classification. 
In this research we explore the use of pretrained deep convolutional neural networks learning models for the classification task on log-Mel Spectrograms. Five pretrained models
(Xception, Vgg16, Vgg198, ResNet50, Inception V3) along with model stacking are compared with respect to two datasets namely, Mozilla Common Voice and Speech Accent dataset.
The research was able to achieve 95% accuracy for gender classification while the age group and nationality classification achieved satisfactory results with accuracy 52% and 48% accuracy respectively which can further be utilized to develop enhanced models.
